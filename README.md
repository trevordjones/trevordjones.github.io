#Github User Page

This readme really isn't very important. But I get that annoying notice that I need to have one. But since you're here!

###New Repositories soon

Check back throughout the upcoming 2014 summer for new repositories and projects.
I've also got a blog coming soon - so this line will be gone once that's up and I'll be sure to include a link to that as well.

Other places to find me!
